    "This Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and Markdown cells to display your answers to the problems. The notebook is *only* for displaying a readable version of your final answers. The coding will be done in an accompanying `lab.py` file that is imported into the current notebook, and **you will only submit that `lab.py` file**, not this notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional guidelines:\n",
    "- **Labs will have both public tests and hidden tests.** The bulk of your grade will come from your scores on hidden tests, which you will only see on Gradescope after the assignment deadline.\n",
    "- **Do not change the function names in the `lab.py` file!** The functions in the `lab.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name. If you changed something you weren't supposed to, you can find the original code in the course GitHub repository.\n",
    "- Notebooks are nice for testing and experimenting with different implementations before designing your function in your `lab.py` file. You can write code here, but make sure that all of your real work is in the `lab.py` file, since that's all you're submitting.\n",
    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional helper functions to solve the lab, as long as they also end up in `lab.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To ensure that all of the work you want to submit is in `lab.py`, we've included a script named `lab-validation.py` in the lab folder. You shouldn't edit it, but instead, you should call it from the command line (e.g. the Terminal) to test your work.** More details on its usage are given at the bottom of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importing code from `lab.py`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Below, we import the `.py` file that's contained in the same directory as this notebook.\n",
    "* We use the `autoreload` notebook extension to make changes to our `lab.py` file immediately available in our notebook. Without this extension, we would need to restart the notebook kernel to see any changes to `lab.py` in the notebook.\n",
    "    - `autoreload` is necessary because, upon import, `lab.py` is compiled to bytecode (in the directory `__pycache__`). Subsequent imports of `lab` merely import the existing compiled python."

    "Professor Aritra often sends out extra credit surveys asking students for their favorite animals, movies, and other favorite things. These surveys are stored in the `data/extra-credit-surveys` folder. Each file in that folder corresponds to a different survey question (except for `favorite1.csv`, which contains students' names and IDs).\n",

    "- Each student who has completed at least 50% of the survey questions receives 5 points of extra credit.\n",
    "- If there is at least one survey question that at least 90% of the class answered (e.g. favorite animal), **everyone** in the class receives 1 point of extra credit. This overall class extra credit only applies twice, so if for example 95% of students answer the favorite color survey question and 91% answer the favorite animal survey question, and and 97% answer the favorite movie question, the entire class still receives 2 extra point as a class, not 3.\n",
