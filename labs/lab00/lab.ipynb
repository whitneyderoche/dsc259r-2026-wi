    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to DSC 259R! The goal of this Lab 0 is to make sure that your Python environment is set up for the course. There are no content-related coding questions in this lab, but if you are able to complete this assignment, then you will be ready to start working on Lab 1 (and the remainder of this course).\n",
    "\n",
    "In DSC 259R, we will emulate a standard workflow in industry where exploration is done in Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) and production code is copied into a normal Python files (`.py` files). Notice that this file is a notebook (`lab.ipynb`) and there is also a `lab.py` file in the same parent folder of this notebook. For this lab (and future assignments), the coding will be done in an accompanying `lab.py` file that is imported into the current notebook, and **you will only submit that `lab.py` file**, not this notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional guidelines:\n",
    "- **Future labs will have both public tests and hidden tests.** The bulk of your grade will come from your scores on hidden tests, which you will only see on Gradescope after the assignment deadline.\n",
    "- **Do not change the function names in the `lab.py` file!** The functions in the `lab.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name. If you changed something you weren't supposed to, you can find the original code in the course GitHub repository.\n",
    "- Notebooks are nice for testing and experimenting with different implementations before designing your function in your `lab.py` file. You can write code here, but make sure that all of your real work is in the `lab.py` file, since that's all you're submitting.\n",
    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional helper functions to solve the lab, as long as they also end up in `lab.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To ensure that all of the work you want to submit is in `lab.py`, we've included a script named `lab-validation.py` in the lab folder. You shouldn't edit it, but instead, you should call it from the command line (e.g. the Terminal) to test your work.** More details on its usage are given at the bottom of this notebook."
